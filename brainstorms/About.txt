 As owner and operator of Blue Ridge Classic Mustang for over 20 years I would like to thank all my previous customers and look forward to being of assistance to future customers looking for quality original (OEM) Ford Mustang parts for your restoration project or daily driver.

 My interest with the Pony car started right out of high school in 1974 with the first Mustang I ever owned---a Grabber Blue 1970 BOSS 302.

 Never did I think this car would set my future in the way it did... Since then, I have always owned and driven a classic Mustang, and I am grateful to have found a business opportunity that involves my passion with the Great American Pony car.
